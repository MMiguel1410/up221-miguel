Hello my name is **MIGUEL MIGUEL**, I'm a second year in the MURP program focusing on environmental analysis and policy. My main passion includes environmental justice within mobile home communites and helping redefine the definition of property. This would help fight against the lack of rights these communities face which then leads to a lack of infrastructure and environmental injustices. When not at UCLA, I like to play with my doggy, going on a run, or listening to true crime podcasts ðŸ––

# Class Description

Since the inception on Urban Planning, the concept of space has been utilized to benefit a certain few. The power of data and planning have shaped the cities we live in today. As our technological capabilities grew exponentially, software like Google Maps, ESRI, Satellite Imagery and more, has created a treasure box full of data that can help us recreate the urban space around us. We can now explore worlds, cities, towns, and spaces hundreds of miles away from us. Our creativity can now be explored further in trying to the solve the social, environmental, and urban issues we face. This course will explore two problems to better understand the mapping and coding tools that could help resolve them. Like the LEGOS we all enjoy, data is composed of multiple pieces and therefore, this class will dive into those components to advance our research goals and objectives.

## Class Objectives
* Understand and comprehend the importance of spatial data
* Learn to extrapolate and interpret the components of spatial data
* Research various urban planning problems through spatial and geographic datums
* Learn to navigate through open source spatial datums
* Use spatial tools to create potential solutions to urban problems
