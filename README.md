Hello my name is **MIGUEL MIGUEL**, I'm a second year in the MURP program focusing on environmental analysis and policy. My main passion includes environmental justice within mobile home communites and helping redefine the definition of property. This would help fight against the lack of rights these communities face which then leads to a lack of infrastructure and environmental injustices. When not at UCLA, I like to play with my dog/son, going on a run, or listening to true crime podcasts
