Hello my name is **MIGUEL MIGUEL**, I'm a second year in the MURP program focusing on environmental analysis and policy. My main passion includes environmental justice within mobile home communites and helping redefine the definition of property. This would help fight against the lack of rights these communities face which then leads to a lack of infrastructure and environmental injustices. When not at UCLA, I like to play with my doggy, going on a run, or listening to true crime podcasts ðŸ––

# Class Description

Since the inception on Urban Planning, the concept of space has been utilized to benefit a certain few. The power of data and planning have shaped the cities we live in today. As our technological capabilities grew exponentially, software like Google Maps, ESRI, Satellite Imagery and more, has created a treasure box full of data that can help us recreate the urban space around us. We can now explore worlds, cities, towns, and spaces hundreds of miles away from us. Our creativity can now be explored further in trying to the solve the social, environmental, and urban issues we face. This course will explore two problems to better understand the mapping and coding tools that could help resolve them. Like the LEGOS we all enjoy, data is composed of multiple pieces and therefore, this class will dive into those components to advance our research goals and objectives.

## Class Objectives
* Understand and comprehend the importance of spatial data
* Learn to extrapolate and interpret the components of spatial data
* Research various urban planning problems through spatial and geographic datums
* Learn to navigate through open source spatial datums
* Use spatial tools to create potential solutions to urban problems

# Project Ideas
 
## Idea 1
There are a total of 50+ mobilehome communities in the City of Los Angeles. These communities are typically located within industrial areas of the city which is then reflected through the Healthy Place Index or CalEnviroscreen 4.0. However, some predominately white mobile home communities have higher standards on environmental regulation. This Project would analyze the current health index of these communities and compare it with the entho racial composition of the surrounding neighborhood. Creating this relationship could help us understand if the health index is dependent on the ehtno racial composition of the surrounding neighborhood despite their geographic location. In short, does a higher white population lead to higher health indexes despite the urban form surrounding the mobile home communities.  

## Idea 2
The County of Los Angeles just passed Measure W not to long ago which established the Safe Clean Water Program. This program aims to provide local, dedicated funding to increase water supply, improve water quality, and provide community enhancements throughout LA County. However, with most programs like thise, there exists a fear if the allocation of these funds are provided to communities of predominantly white patrons. This project would analyze current hydrologic data to create a profile of current projects, proposed projects, and combine Census data to understand where these projects are currently active.
